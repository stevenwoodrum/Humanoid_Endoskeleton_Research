# Humanoid Endoskeleton Research

**Summer 2015**

![Piper, my first HR-OS1 build](../blob/master/Piper-and-Me.jpg?raw=true)

A small undergraduate cohort tested and integrated software on the HR-OS1 robot beta-released by [Trossen Robotics](http://www.trossenrobotics.com/HR-OS1).  Personal successes include connecting publicly available speech generation and vision modules to the robot's open-source Linux framework.

Worked with team to wrap the [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/) (ROS) around the pre-existing framework.

Our team laid the foundation for future undergraduate research in human-robot interaction at the University of Virginia.  As of Fall 2015, our groundwork is being used by multiple students in their undergraduate capstone.
